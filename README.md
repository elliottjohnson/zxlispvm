# ZXLISPVM: A Lisp bytecode interpreter for ZX-Spectrum

Bytecode interpreter inspired by MIT [AIM-514](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/5731).

No REPL/tokenizer is included in this version, although I remember implementing some - along with a nibble-sized fontset.

IIRC there's a crashing bug lurking in the garbage collector implementation.
